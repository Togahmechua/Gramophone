# ðŸŽµ Gramophone

**Gramophone** is a creative and relaxing puzzle game where players connect vintage gramophones to their matching music discs.  
Each gramophone will only play when linked to the correct disc, requiring keen observation, strategic thinking,  
and precise line-drawing skills. Create longer chains â€” or even complete loops â€” to clear a stage.  
Be careful: wrong links or crossing lines will force you to start again.  
Complete all connections to enjoy the nostalgic melody of the gramophone and the satisfying sense of victory.
